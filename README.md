# Opened.AI challenge
*******************************************************************************************
**Dependencies-**
1. Python 2.7 or 3+
2. OS: linux
3. Python libraries - OpenCV and dlib
All the dependencies should be met before installing face recognition module

**Installation:**
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install keras
pip3 install face_recognition

** Output Test Videos **
1. ai2.mp4 
2. ai3.mp4

**Opened.ai folder contains two python codes-**
1. new.py - gui + face recognizer(open this to run software)
2. face_re.py - face identifier and recognizer 

It also contains 'Images' folder in which we keep the set of images of faces which we want to recognize.
**Kindly change the path of your Images folder in the code on line 82 of new.py

**Project Title â€“ Automated Attendence System**

We have tried to build a software with which we can automatically mark the attendence of students that are coming inside a room by detecting their faces using camera and then recognizing the name of the person (if the person is already stored in the database, if not, it gives the output as unknown) 

**Applications:**
It can be used anywhere where there is a need to mark the attendence of the people attending the event. For example - It can be used in a school to take attendence of students in a class by tagging the camera in front of classroom which can record the face of the students entering the classroom and the corresponding time at which the student entered. This will be saved in a .csv file which can be accessed by the teacher/ principal to get the attendence. 

**More applications:**
Marking attendence in:
1. Colleges
2. Factories / Industries
3. Offices
4. Seminars
5. Any other place where attendence needs to be marked

**Benefits:**

**1. Saves Time:**
It saves time that is usually incurred to take attendence in the class. This is especially effective where the class size is too big that usually results in taking too much time out of the period. This results in less time devoted to teaching in the class. By using Automated Attendence System, we can save that crucial time and increase teaching time.

**2. Transparency:**
Since it automatically marks attendence based upon the video feed, there is full transparency in terms of who is present or who is absent. Nobody can alter this result based upon their wish. There can be no adulteration with attendence of students and teachers and exact attendence will be recorded. This will lead to punctuality on the parts of teachers and students as they now know that their attendence is being taken by software.

**3. Accountability:**
Since the problem we are dealing is of less attendence in government schools. The reason behind this is very less interest of teachers in teaching. It happens most of the time that very less teachers come to school. So with this system we can even monitor the teachers as well. So our system will automatically capture the time and name of person. So we can take strict action if someone is not coming on time in school.
